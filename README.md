# mb-matric-test

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Run the Capital Growth Analyzer directly

```bash
python capital_growth_analyzer.py
```

This will load the raw data from the `data/` directory and display information about the loaded datasets.

### Option 2: Run the Flask web application

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the URL shown in the terminal).

Note: The Flask app is currently incomplete and needs to be implemented.
